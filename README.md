# Hiya-tech

Hiya-tech is a MERN stack apllication that's deployed through Netlify.

## About

Hiya-tech is a website that allows users to buy and trade technology items without any issue. 

This website is a practical marketplace where users can post an item to sell/trade or offer a services related to technology. We wanted to create a more specified service that would offer users a more focused experience than other sites such as Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace. 

## Deployment (Netlify)

[Hiya-tech](https://hiya-tech.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage

First off make sure you have a local version of MongoDB running on your machine. This project will make a local database for you called `appDB`.

```
mongod
```

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in the root directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

After all installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

That's it, your app should be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
